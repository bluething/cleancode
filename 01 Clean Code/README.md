#### Code will be with us forever

We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements.  
At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted, they have to be specified.

#### Bad Code

Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code?

#### Why bad code exist?

- Rush into production.  
- Don't have time to think a good design.  
- Bugs were not repaired from one release to the next.  
- Leaving technical debt. Remember LeBlanc’s law: Later equals never. Treat technical debt like credit card debt.

#### Impact of bad code

1. More bugs.  
2. Bad code is technical debt, and technical debt means slower and slower development.  
3. Lowe job satisfaction. How do we deal with code created in the past?

Robert Martin, "Indeed the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code therefore making it easy to read makes it easier to write."

What will happen when productivity decreases?  
- Frustrated.  
- Management try to hire more engineer?  
- Rewrite?

#### Attitude

How often do we do the following?  
- We complain that the requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design.  
- We bemoan the schedules that were too tight to do things right.  
- We blather about stupid managers and intolerant customers and useless marketing types and telephone sanitizers.

**From now on stop!** The fault lies with ourselves, because we are unprofessional.  
- The managers look to us for the information they need to make promises and commitments. They want the truth, even when they don’t act like it.  
- The users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system.  
- The project managers look to us to help work out the schedule.

#### What the definition of clean code?

- Easy to read. Clean code reads like well-written prose.  
- Easy to maintain. The code can be enhanced by a developer other than its original author.  
- Elegant. The code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
- Efficient, time and space complexity.
- Have a proper tests.

#### We Are Authors

Do you use `@author` field of a Javadoc to tells us who we are? Stop it right now!

We are author. The next time we write a line of code, remember we are an author, writing for readers who will judge our effort.

#### The Boy Scout Rule

_Leave the campground cleaner than you found it._

#### Who should care about clean code?

1. Developers.  
2. Test automation engineers.  
3. Project managers. They must understand the importance of technical debt and allocate time and budget for it.
